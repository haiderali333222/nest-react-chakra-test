This is a shopping list web application built with React and Chakra UI. The app connects to a NestJS backend using Apollo Client for data fetching and mutations, allowing users to manage their shopping list by adding, viewing, and deleting items.

View Items: All items in the shopping list are displayed with their name, description, and quantity.
Delete Items: Users can delete items from the shopping list with a confirmation dialog.
Pagination: The list supports loading items in pages with a "Load More" button.
Toasts: Success and error messages are displayed using toasts for interactions like adding or deleting items.


Technologies Used
React: Frontend JavaScript library for building the user interface.
Chakra UI: A simple, modular, and accessible component library for React.
Apollo Client: A comprehensive state management library that allows you to interact with a GraphQL API.
GraphQL: A query language for the API to fetch and mutate data.
NestJS: Backend framework (already implemented) to manage the API for this frontend.
